## Goals

Based on previous analysis:

- Create dotnet microservices in both compilation modes (JIT and AOT) and publish them as docker images
- Setup and configure full deployment stack as docker-compose file(s)
- Configure monitoring tools, data collection and logging
- Prepare and run test scenarios using images from both compilation modes
- Compare the results and present them in static and interactive (Grafana) form
